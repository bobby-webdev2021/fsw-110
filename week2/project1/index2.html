    <h3>What drove me to go to college?</h3>
    <p>I have wanted to go to college for quite some time. Before starting the program with Bryan University <br> I was looking into going to school locally for a certificate in hvac.
    After speaking with the admissions counselor <br> I decided that i didnt wasnt to do traditional college with having a full time job i wouldnt really have the time. <br> A few months went by and I started investing just for fun with crypto coins. I became interested in the way they<br>
    work. After doing a little research I started reading about Blockchain Development and that is the main thing <br> that got me wanting to learn more about Web Development and what drove me to begin college.   </p>
